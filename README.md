# OCEAnS
This repository is part of "Open Coding Enabling Analysis Sharing" (OCEAnS). OCEAnS is an initiative to promote sharing code and provide researchers with the tools to make this as easy as possible.

In this repository, you will find the following documents:

- An empty R Markdown template that helps you to structure your analyses
- A filled in R Markdown template that shows an example analysis (mortality ~ smoking)
- A document with tips and tricks that is specifically targeted to new PhD students at the department of epidemiology at Erasmus MC (Note: It contains useful information on setting up R Markdown and free resources)
- Documents in html format can best be opened by downloading the raw file

Please note that these documents can be adapted to your specific needs and that it may not always be necessary to use the template as a whole.
